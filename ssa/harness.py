"""LLM entrant harness.

Every frontier-model entrant runs through this module each refresh. Production
has one mode and fails closed:

1. REAL: when an API key for the provider is present in the environment, the
   model is asked for a forecast through a uniform prompt and the reply is
   parsed into {"mean", "sd"}. Keys are read from env so they can live in
   GitHub Actions secrets (Settings > Secrets > Actions) or any other deploy
   platform's secret store; nothing is ever committed.

2. LOCAL MOCK (opt-in): setting ``SSA_ALLOW_MOCK=1`` lets the scalar path file a
   deterministic, clearly labelled placeholder for local pipeline development.
   Automation never sets it, and profile/ranking paths never mock because a
   fabricated vector or list has no honest placeholder semantics. Missing keys
   and failed calls otherwise raise and file nothing.

Three wire protocols cover all thirteen entered models, so no vendor SDKs are
needed:
  openai    - /chat/completions (OpenAI, xAI, and the Qwen/Kimi/GLM/MiniMax
              gateway, which all speak it)
  anthropic - /v1/messages
  gemini    - /models/{m}:generateContent

Model id and endpoint are both overridable per entrant without touching code:
  SSA_MODEL_GROK=grok-4.3   SSA_BASE_QWEN=https://my-gateway/compatible-mode/v1

And a whole entrant can be moved to a different *route* -- a different key,
protocol, host and model id at once -- with SSA_OPENROUTER, for when a vendor
account stops serving in a way no code change fixes. Off unless set, manual
rather than automatic, and recorded in every forecast it produces, because the
endpoint is part of the condition. See docs/routes.md.

Cost control: a forecast is only re-requested when its inputs changed. Every
filed forecast carries in=<hash of the prompt> in its notes; if the hash still
matches, the existing file is kept and no API call is made. So a round costs
one call per model per new observation, not one per refresh. Behind that sits
the reply log (ssa/replies.py): every reply is written to disk on arrival and
before it is parsed, so a bad parse or a run that dies mid-flight costs the
tokens once rather than once per attempt.

# Reasoning depth is set as high as each provider allows, and the parameter is
# not portable -- getting it wrong is a 400, not a silent downgrade:
#   OpenAI     reasoning_effort; GPT-5.6 takes none/low/medium/high/xhigh
#              and rejects "max", so xhigh is the ceiling there
#   Anthropic  thinking {type: adaptive} + output_config {effort: "max"}. The
#              older {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N} is REJECTED on Opus 5,
#              Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5 and Fable 5.
#   xAI        reasoning_effort, only low/medium/high; defaults to high and
#              cannot be disabled, so "high" is already the ceiling.
#   gateway    Kimi, GLM, MiniMax and Qwen ride one OpenAI-compatible gateway
#              whose effort support is undocumented, so nothing is sent.
# "max" is rejected by the GPT-5.6 models with an explicit list of what they do
# take: none/low/medium/high/xhigh. xhigh is their ceiling, so that is maximum
# effort here despite the value differing from Anthropic's.
# **Nothing is sent any more, from 2026-09-20.** What used to be here:
#
#     OPENAI_MAX_EFFORT    = {"reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
#     ANTHROPIC_MAX_EFFORT = {"thinking": {"type": "adaptive"},
#                             "output_config": {"effort": "max"}}
#     XAI_MAX_EFFORT       = {"reasoning_effort": "high"}
#
# Two findings retired them on the same day, and either alone would have been
# enough.
#
# **It stopped working.** The sponsor's gateway serves `claude-sonnet-5` from
# more than one upstream, and one of them is Bedrock, which answers
# `output_config.effort` with `ValidationException: 'max' is not supported for
# this model`. Which upstream a call lands on is not ours to choose, so the
# entrant became a lottery: 24 of 24 succeeded in a standalone probe and 11 of
# 12 failed in the run that mattered. An entrant that files by luck is not an
# entrant.
#
# **It was never shown to be worth paying for.** Measured on one real round,
# the same prompt at max, at low and with no block at all returned 35.5, 35.5
# and 35.4 -- a tenth of a point apart -- while max spent 213 output tokens
# against 21. Across the season the depth is where roughly four fifths of the
# model bill goes, and the arena's own numbers have never shown it buying
# accuracy: cost against skill is -0.03, and output length against skill is
# *negative*.
#
# So every entrant now runs at its vendor's default depth. That is one
# sentence to state in the paper instead of a per-entrant table, and
# `effort_label` still writes the depth into every forecast's notes -- it now
# reads `effort=default`, which is a claim, not an absence.
#
# This changes the condition, and `call_identity` carries the parameter block,
# so forecasts bought before today are not comparable to forecasts bought
# after it at the level of a single entrant's skill number. Rounds already
# locked keep their scores untouched; `claude-sonnet-web` and
# `claude-sonnet-web-superfc` carry 37 rounds each from the max era, and that
# boundary is 2026-09-20.

# Temperature is deliberately never set. Current frontier models on OpenAI and
# Anthropic reject it outright, and elsewhere the provider default (~1.0) is
# what we want: a rerun is not meant to reproduce, the committed record of raw
# replies is.

# --- routes ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A *route* is where a model is actually reached: which key opens it, which
# wire protocol it speaks, which host serves it, and what it is called there.
# Every model above has a direct route -- its own vendor. Some also have an
# OpenRouter route, which is one key and one OpenAI-compatible endpoint in
# front of all of them.
#
# This exists because a vendor account can stop serving in a way that no code
# change fixes. On 2026-08-14 the Anthropic organisation was disabled (HTTP
# 400, "This organization has been disabled") and the OpenAI account ran out of
# credits (HTTP 429, insufficient_quota). That is seven of fifteen entrants
# dead on every six-hourly refresh, on rounds whose locks do not wait.
#
# **Opting in is manual and per entrant, never automatic.** An automatic
# failover on an error would move an entrant to a different endpoint mid-season
# on a transient 429, and nothing on the leaderboard would say so. The endpoint
# is part of the condition, not a detail of it: two hosts can serve different
# weights under one model name, quantise differently, or reach a different
# reasoning depth. So the switch is a repository variable a human sets, and it
# is recorded in every forecast it produces.
OPENROUTER_BASE = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
# The name the secret is provisioned under. Not OPENROUTER_API_KEY: renaming
# the lookup without renaming the secret drops the route silently, which is
# exactly how the SSA_BASE_QWEN override was lost once already.
OPENROUTER_ENV = "OPEN_ROUTER"

# Model ids on OpenRouter, written out rather than derived. `vendor/model` is a
# convention, not a rule -- Kimi is `moonshotai/`, GLM is `z-ai/`, Grok is
# `x-ai/` -- and a derived id that is wrong is a 404 at lock time.
#
# Every entry is a model OpenRouter's public catalogue actually lists, checked
# against https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models (keyless, free) rather than
# guessed. One model is deliberately absent:
#
#   qwen-3.7  OpenRouter carries `qwen/qwen3.7-max`, the floating alias, and
#             not the dated `qwen3.7-max-2026-05-20` snapshot this entrant is
#             pinned to. An alias that rolls forward mid-season silently swaps
#             the entrant, and scores from before and after are not comparable.
#             The pin is worth more than the redundancy.
#
# qwen-3.8 used to be kept out too, for symmetry with 3.7 -- but its direct
# route already runs the floating alias `qwen3.8-max` (DashScope publishes no
# dated snapshot for it), so routing it through OpenRouter's `qwen/qwen3.8-max`
# changes the host, not the kind of pointer. Added 2026-08-26 after the
# DashScope gateway dropped the connection on three consecutive runs, both
# arms, exactly on the two large-prompt round types (ranking and profile) --
# small prompts filed fine, so this is a gateway limit, not a model failure.
# `call_identity` hashes the base, so the switch correctly re-runs the failed
# cells and cannot silently reuse a stale direct-route reply. (Catalogue
# checked 2026-08-26: `qwen/qwen3.8-max` is listed.)

#
# `high` is the top of OpenRouter's unified scale, and it is **not** the same
# depth as the direct route's ceiling: OpenAI's own `xhigh` sits above `high`,
# and Anthropic's `effort: max` is its own scale entirely. So a routed entrant
# is the same weights asked to think somewhat less hard, which is a real
# difference and the reason `via=openrouter` is written into the forecast.

# --- the sponsor's gateway -------------------------------------------------
#
# PP API is an aggregator like OpenRouter, with one difference that matters
# here: it is paid for by a sponsor rather than out of the maintainers' pocket,
# so it is the *primary* route for the models switched on for it and the
# vendor's own account is the fallback. That inversion is the whole point --
# `standby_route` below returns the direct route when this one is primary --
# and it is why this block exists instead of repointing `OPENROUTER_BASE`.
#
# **Disclosure.** A sponsor paying for the inference that produces published
# scores is a fact about the benchmark, not an implementation detail. Every
# forecast bought here records `via=ppapi`, and the site and the paper have to
# say so in words as well.
#
# The published base is `https://app.ppapi.ai`, and the three protocols sit
# under it exactly where our three call sites put them: the quick-start
# documents `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages` and
# `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`, so `SSA_PPAPI_BASE` ending at `/v1`
# serves the first two by concatenation and the gemini base is that with the
# tail swapped. Checked 2026-09-18 against the vendor's own quick-start table.
#
# It stays a variable rather than a constant anyway. Not because the address is
# unknown, but because an unset variable is what makes this route inert: a
# constant here would route every named model the moment the key appeared in
# the environment, and the key is a secret somebody adds for a different reason
# first. The error below names the documented value, so setting it is one
# copy-paste rather than a search.
PPAPI_BASE_ENV = "SSA_PPAPI_BASE"
PPAPI_BASE_GEMINI_ENV = "SSA_PPAPI_BASE_GEMINI"
# The name the secret was actually provisioned under. Renaming this lookup
# without renaming the secret drops the route in silence.
PPAPI_ENV = "SA_BASELINE_HS"

# Unlike OpenRouter, which speaks one protocol, PP API serves all three on one
# host under different prefixes: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages` and
# `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`. Our callers build the first two
# from a base ending at `/v1` and the third from a base ending at `/v1beta`,
# so the gemini base is a separate value rather than the same one.
PPAPI_GEMINI_SUFFIX = "/v1beta"

# Model ids on the sponsor's gateway, read off its own catalogue with
# `tools/check_ppapi_catalogue.py` rather than copied from its brochure.
# Checked 2026-09-18 against `https://app-us.ppapi.ai/v1/models`, 140 models.
#
# The brochure was wrong in the direction that matters, which is why the tool
# exists: it advertises `grok-4.6`, and the catalogue in fact carries the
# `grok-4.5` this season scores. Guessing from the page would have kept a model
# off the gateway for no reason; guessing the other way would have scored a
# different model under an entrant's name.
#
# **Two are refused, and both refusals are the point.**
#
#   gemini-flash  we score `gemini-3.6-flash`. The gateway serves 2.5, 3.5,
#                 3.7 and 3.8 -- every neighbour and not that one. Routing it
#                 would change which model answers for an entrant whose
#                 published scores already run on 3.6, and its history would
#                 stop being comparable with itself.
#   qwen-3.7      pinned to the dated snapshot `qwen3.7-max-2026-05-20`; the
#                 gateway has only the floating `qwen3.7-max`, which rolls
#                 forward mid-season. The same reason `OPENROUTER_MODELS`
#                 leaves it out, and the pin is still worth more than the
#                 redundancy.
#
# `kimi` and `minimax` differ only in spelling -- the gateway drops the vendor
# prefix the direct route carries -- and are the same weights under the same
# version. Recorded here rather than left commented out, because "same model,

# up measuring tool-calling competence rather than whether search helps. That
# is the vendor-index confound in a new costume, and the whole point of running
# one index is to be rid of it. A fixed number of plain-text turns gives every
# entrant byte-identical scaffolding, a bounded cost, and no loop that can run
# away -- and it reuses the JSON parser the forecast reply already goes through.

    the topline came out of the reply log rather than out of a call, which the
    caller writes into the notes -- a forecast has to say whether it was bought
    now or recovered.

    **This is where the reply log is read and written, both routes.** Not in
    `forecast`, which knows only the configured route's hash: a reply bought
    from the standby is keyed under the standby's hash, and that is precisely
    the run most likely to have died halfway -- the standby exists for days when
    a vendor account is disabled. Checking one hash in the caller would resume
    the easy case and re-buy the hard one. So each hash is looked up immediately
    before the call that would otherwise pay for it, and every reply is logged
    the moment it lands, before `parse` gets a chance to reject it.

    Three further properties are worth stating, because each is a bug that was
    available here:

    **A forecast keeps the hash of the route that produced it.** So when the
    vendor account comes back, the direct hash no longer matches, the next run
    re-asks the vendor, and the entrant is upgraded out of the standby without
    anyone having to notice it had been demoted. The reverse -- storing the
    direct hash for a fallback forecast -- would pin the entrant to the standby
    for the rest of the season.

    **The standby's own cache is checked before it is billed.** Without that,
    a fallback forecast never matches the direct hash, so every six-hourly run
    would re-buy an answer to a prompt that had not changed.

    **A dead route is remembered for the process only.** One terminal failure
    marks it, and the remaining entrants on that route skip straight to the
    standby instead of each paying a failed request first. Nothing is written
